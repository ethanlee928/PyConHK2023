# Streamlit &mdash; Creating Interactive Websites with Ease

Materials for PyCon Hong Kong 2023

## Abstract

Streamlit is a Python library for creating interactive web applications with ease. It provides built-in tools and widgets for adding interactivity, integrates with popular data science libraries like pandas and scikit-learn, and allows for the deployment of web apps with just a few lines of code.

This talk will explore the different potentials of using Streamlit with three examples: creating a static page, a page for data visualization, and a page for real-time computer vision applications. First, we will discuss the basics of Streamlit by building a static page, which is suitable even for Python beginners. It aims to illustrate the convenience of Streamlit by showing how one can create a styled, responsive self-introduction page in minutes.
For data visualization, we will create an interactive page of Monte-Carlo Simulation on the stock market, which aims to illustrate the integration between Streamlit and some popular data science libraries.

Lastly, we will utilize the open-source library streamlit-webrtc, which allows users to easily use real-time video/audio streams on Streamlit apps, to build a real-time computer vision application.

In short, this talk introduces an emerging Python libraryâ€”Streamlit. It is a powerful tool for data scientists and machine learning engineers for research and development.
